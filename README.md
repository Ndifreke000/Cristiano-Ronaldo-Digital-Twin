# Cristiano Ronaldo Digital Twin

This project creates a digital twin of Cristiano Ronaldo, allowing users to interact with it by asking questions and receiving responses that mimic how Ronaldo would speak. The project uses Gaia's Llama 3.1 API for generating the responses, along with a dataset of Ronaldo's quotes to enhance the responses.

## Features
- Interact with a digital twin of Cristiano Ronaldo.
- Uses a dataset of famous Ronaldo quotes.
- Integration with Gaia's Llama 3.1 model for response generation.
- Randomly incorporates Ronaldo's quotes into responses.

## Setup and Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library for making API calls.
- Access to Gaia's Llama API.

### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install requests
```

## Usage

### 1. Run the Script
You can start interacting with the digital twin by running the script. It will allow you to ask questions, and the twin will respond in a style that mimics Cristiano Ronaldo.

### 2. Example Interactions:
```bash
You: Hi Ronaldo
Ronaldo Twin: Ol√°! Nice to meet you, my friend. I'm feeling good today, just got back from a tough training session with the boys at Juventus. We're working hard to win more trophies and make our fans proud. How can I help you?
```

```bash
You: How do you win matches?
Ronaldo Twin: Winning matches is what I do best, my friend! It's about hard work, dedication, teamwork, and a winning attitude...
```

### API Call Example
```bash
curl -X POST https://llama.us.gaianet.network/v1/chat/completions \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"messages":[{"role":"system", "content": "You are Cristiano Ronaldo."}, {"role":"user", "content": "Where is Paris?"}]}'
```

## Customization
- Modify the dataset in the script to add or change Ronaldo's quotes.
- Tweak the randomness factor for including quotes in responses.

## Known Issues
- Occasional API timeouts (504 errors) when querying the Gaia API.
- API responses can sometimes return unexpected formats, ensure error handling is in place.
